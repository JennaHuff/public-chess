This is an old unfinished chess game in Python

Playing chess in a terminal taught me that web browsers are a good UI option

-----
To do:

pawns can take vertically

pawns can only promote to queens

scores should count the difference between total pieces, not just taken pieces

when prompted to pick a piece to promote to, input is not guarded

a king in check should blink red. 
cannot move any piece when in check, unless the piece is the king or the piece  

players should take turns playing  
handle inputs such as "Nd1xc3", or "e4"
